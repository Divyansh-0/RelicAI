# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# TO INITIALIZE 

Frontend 

- npm install ( It will install all the frontend dependencies)
- npm run dev ( To run the frontend )

Backend 

- Install the venv dependency ( Dont remember the command for that )
- cd backend
- python server.py

The main image Search logic is in * Test.py * file.

# The Problem

The test.py prompts us the enter the value for this in terminal and this should be automated. We have to figure this out !!
